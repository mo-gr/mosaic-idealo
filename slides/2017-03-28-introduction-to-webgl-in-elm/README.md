# Introduction to WebGL in Elm

Slides from the [Elm Berlin Meetup #3](https://www.meetup.com/Elm-Berlin/events/238210075/).

## Abstract

I will outline the history of WebGL in Elm, including my recent contribution that I did with the help from Evan. I will explain how the graphics pipeline works and how Elm makes it easier. In the end, I will show some demos, that will hopefully leave you inspired to create something of your own.

The latter got him interested in WebGL and then he became a maintainer of the library. Apart from work, he enjoys live music in Berlin and is a yoga newbie.
